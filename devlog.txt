OBSTACLES OVERCOME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  wow we so BOSS bc...
  - we got projectiles to hit first zombie in row
  - we got every row to work!
  - we created working peashooter class!
  - we created working sunlight class!
  - we created different working levels!
  - we created different types of zombies!
  - we got an info and instructions screen!

UNRESOLVED ISSUES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - after zombie dies, plant is outline (stroke() call somewhere?)
  -
COOL STUFF LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - wow! oo!...
  - processing is pretty neat. it can handle a ton of stuff.
  - how to create start screen.
  - how to create flow of game (including info and instructions).

MID-DEVELOPMENT DESIGN CHANGES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  we changed ___ to ___ bc...
  - we changed zombie queues to ArrayLists bc we realized queues were not needed
  - we changed projectile queues to heaps bc we realized it was a good idea to implement them as heaps based on the very definition of heaps
  - we created a parent class of plant and subclasses of peashooter and sunflower in order to keep plant array working in PvZ
  - we decided to have an instructions screen in order to teach the user how to play the game and what each visual element means and how they can interact with the visual elements

LESSONS LEARNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - we don't have to overcomplicate things. simplicity is key
  - drawings + kts <3
  - easier to split up functions and work for cleaner code
  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
