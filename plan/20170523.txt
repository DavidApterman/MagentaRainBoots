Each person takes one of 1, 2, or 3.
Need to collaboratively tackle 4, 5.
We can figure it out from there.
Finish 1, 2, 3 by tomorrow or over the weekend if we are busy tomorrow.
We will plan out next steps afterwards together.




Chronology:
Work in order shown. Create MVP first.
Make sure that MVP works. Need to implement 1,2,3 in order to link graphics w/ classes and create level 0.
Implement MaxHeap + Heapsort for Projectiles / MergeSort + ArrayList for Zombies.
Need to create first level before moving on to other levels.
Need to create most basic plants and zombies before creating different types.
Need to implement easiest difficulty before attempting to implement harder difficulties.
