Priority:
!! A New Priority Has Appeared !!
Create underlying 2D-array for plants on the field :
    Carve out the field into unseen blocks represented as positions in a 2D array to accomodate plant placement.

Implement MaxHeap + Heapsort for Projectiles :
    Wait for team day to tackle as a whole and implement a robust and swanky heap.

MergeSort + ArrayList for Zombies :
   MergeSort code and ArrayLists are in, task now is to expand Zombie variability and complexity.

1. Write up basic classes for plant and zombie 
2. Skeleton of field using processing
3. Implement basic graphic representation of plants, zombies, and sunlight
4. Functionally link the graphics with respective java classes
5. Create level 0 with single row operating on queues
6. Expand game to multiple rows and levels
7. Create different types of plants and zombies (bosses and mini bosses)
8. Implement different levels of difficulty




Workload Sharing:
Work together to implement MaxHeap + Heapsort for Projectiles / MergeSort + ArrayList for Zombies.
Each person takes one of 1, 2, or 3.
Need to collaboratively tackle 4, 5.
We can figure it out from there.
Finish 1, 2, 3 by tomorrow or over the weekend if we are busy tomorrow.
We will plan out next steps afterwards together.




Chronology:
Work in order shown. Create MVP first.
Make sure that MVP works. Need to implement 1,2,3 in order to link graphics w/ classes and create level 0.
Implement MaxHeap + Heapsort for Projectiles / MergeSort + ArrayList for Zombies.
Need to create first level before moving on to other levels.
Need to create most basic plants and zombies before creating different types.
Need to implement easiest difficulty before attempting to implement harder difficulties.
