# MagentaRainBoots - V.T.L.F.C.U.H.C
## David Apterman, Jesse Sit, Henry Zheng 

  V.T.L.F.C.U.H.C is our representation of Plants vs. Zombies coded in Processing. The project presents a field onto which the user can place plants to combat incoming zombies. Currently there is no pre-level or welcome screen with an in-game description, but we are intending to make one. 
  
  The user is able to place plants, which immediately fire (generate) projectiles. The project uses ALHeaps and MergeSort to check collisions between plant projectiles and zombies to implement the user's defense. The user also can see how much sunlight he currently holds, much like the game. However, we have not implemented the cost of plants yet.

  Launch instructions -> To run this program, navigate to the MagentaRainBoots folder, and use `processing PvZ/PvZ.pde` in terminal to start up processing. Then, `Ctrl-R` to run.
  
  Currently, you can place plants by pressing on the plant text on the top and then clicking somewhere on the field. Projectiles do not work right now because we are impelementing heaps.
