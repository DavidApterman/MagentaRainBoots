  The project presents a field onto which the user can place plants to combat incoming zombies. Currently there is no pre-level or welcome screen with an in-game description, but we are intending to make one. 
  
  The user is able to place plants, which immediately fire (generate) projectiles. The project uses ALHeaps and MergeSort to check collisions between plant projectiles and zombies to implement the user's defense. 

  Launch instructions -> navigate to PvZ folder, run PvZ.pde in processing.
